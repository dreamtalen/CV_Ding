\begin{rSection}{Publications}
\textbf{Yongming Ding}, Wei Jin, Guanghui He, Weifeng He. ``Short Path Padding with Multiple-Vt cells for Wide-Pulsed-Latch Based Circuits at Ultra-Low Voltage.'' \emph{IEEE International Conference on ASIC}  (2017). Accepted.
\end{rSection}

\begin{rSection}{RESEARCHES AND PROJECTS}
\textbf{Short Path Padding Technique Design} \hfill \emph{July. 2016 - present}
\\$\diamond$ Designed and implemented a short path padding software system employing integer linear programming method, which supports up to a wide pulse of 1/3 cycle time in pulsed-latch pipelines.
\\$\diamond$ Proposed step-by-step based and path group based schemes to reduce up to 80.9\% runtime of the baseline padding algorithm and used multiple-Vt buffer cells to reduce additional hardware cost by 52.3\%, on average. 
\\\textbf{Image Super-Resolution Using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)} \hfill \emph{July. 2017}
\\$\diamond$  Applied deep learning techniques to sharpen or improve the quality of a low-resolution image input by outputting a super-resolved high-resolution image. Proposed a 7-layers CNN which got lower loss value and reduced 10\% training time, compared with ``waifu2x'', a open source image super-resolution software.
\\\textbf{``Eye of Providence'', an Intelligent Monitoring System} \hfill \emph{May. 2017}
\\$\diamond$ Led a group of 4 teammates to build an intelligent classroom monitoring system using face recognition, facial expression detection and speech identification techniques during ``Hackathon SJTU 2017''.
\\\textbf{Three-dimensional Integrated Circuit(3D-IC) Partitioning Technique Design} \hfill \emph{Jan. 2016 - Jun. 2016}
\\$\diamond$ Excellent graduate thesis in Department of Micro-Nano Electronics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
\\$\diamond$ Designed a 3D-IC partitioning algorithm for motion estimation(ME) module of HEVC, including the initial partition algorithm based on breath first search and the iterative optimization algorithm. Achieved an optimum partition for the ME module, which reduced 43\% of the cut edges while the area utilization rate reached 96\%.
\\\textbf{``Yorozuya'', a Campus Labor and Information Exchange Platform} \hfill \emph{Nov. 2014}
\\$\diamond$  Developed a web application for campus users to exchange labor and information in ``Hackathon SJTU 2014'' with a teammate. Users can release tasks on this app while the others can choose and finish jobs for reward.
